# material-components

A small collection of reusable components implemented with Angular Material.
This library provides opinionated UI components and supporting services/directives built with Angular Material.
The aim is to provide common functionality that's not addressed by Material, like a File Picker for example.

When using this library, you need to pay special attention to your version of `@angular/material`. The
version installed in your application must match the version used by the library.

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test material-components` to execute the unit tests.
